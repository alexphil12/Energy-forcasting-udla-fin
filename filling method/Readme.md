In this filling method folder you will find:
* Some dataframe in form of .txt file containing the performance metric of the methods, the first one contain the performances for all method, distribution, max holes  and features. The features are the 10 best selected by the random forest regressor from this [file](https://github.com/alexphil12/Energy-forcasting-udla-fin/blob/main/grid-search%20optimisation/Optimization_of_hyperparameters.ipynb), you can find over detail on this [notebook](./choice_of_model_to_fill.ipynb). Concerning the more detailed one, it has the same structure but takes more holes sizes limit and only for 1 feature and distribution to have the MAPE graph more precisely.
